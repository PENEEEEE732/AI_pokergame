## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file from `.env.example`:

```env
# --- Application Security ---
# Generate a strong secret key: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
SECRET_KEY=your seacret key here

# --- Debug & Development ---
FLASK_DEBUG=True
FLASK_RUN_HOST=127.0.0.1
FLASK_RUN_PORT=5000

# --- Database Configuration ---
# SQLite (development)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///poker.db

# PostgreSQL (production example)
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost/poker_db

# --- CORS Settings ---
# For production, specify allowed origins instead of *
# CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://yourdomain.com

# --- Game Settings ---
DEFAULT_CHIPS=10000
SMALL_BLIND=50
BIG_BLIND=100

```

### Game Settings
Modify `config.py` to adjust:
- `DEFAULT_CHIPS`: Starting chip count (default: 10000)
- `SMALL_BLIND` / `BIG_BLIND`: Blind amounts
- `MAX_PLAYERS_PER_GAME`: Maximum players per table

## 🎮 AI Difficulty Levels

### 🤖 Easy AI
- Makes random decisions with basic strategy
- Good for beginners learning the game
- Occasionally makes questionable plays

### 🤖 Normal AI  
- Uses hand strength evaluation
- Considers position and pot odds
- Balanced aggression and caution

### 🤖 Hard AI
- Advanced hand reading and range analysis
- Position-aware betting strategies
- Pot odds and implied odds calculations
- Capable of bluffing and semi-bluffing

## 🔌 API Documentation

### Socket.IO Events

#### Client → Server
- `join_game`: Join a game room
  ```json
  { "username": "string", "room_id": "string" }
  ```
- `start_game`: Start a new hand
- `player_action`: Submit player action
  ```json
  { "action": "fold|check|call|bet|raise", "amount": number }
  ```

#### Server → Client
- `game_state_update`: Real-time game state
- `game_over`: Round completion with winners
- `error`: Error notifications

### HTTP API Endpoints
- `POST /api/user`: Create new user
- `GET /api/user/<username>`: Get user information  
- `POST /api/reset_user`: Reset user chips
- `GET /api/games`: List active games
- `GET /api/game/<room_id>`: Get specific game state

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Deployment
1. Set `FLASK_DEBUG=False` in `.env`
2. Generate a strong `SECRET_KEY`
3. Configure production database (PostgreSQL recommended)
4. Set proper CORS origins
5. Use gunicorn for production server:
   ```bash
   gunicorn -k eventlet -w 1 run:app
   ```

### Docker (Optional)
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "run.py"]
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server won't start:**
- Check Python version (requires 3.8+)
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Check port 5000 is available

**Connection errors:**
- Ensure server is running
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Verify CORS settings if accessing from different domain

**Game logic issues:**
- Check server logs for error messages
- Verify database file permissions
- Reset game state if needed

### Logs
- Server logs: `poker_server.log`
- Real-time logs: Browser developer console
